          Airline ticket prices are highly dynamic and subject to change based on various factors such as demand, time of booking,
          and seat availability. Advertised prices are in US dollars and include all relevant taxes, fees, and surcharges, and are
          'from' per person rates based on business class travel during weekdays (Monday through Thursday) from the USA. A minimum
          of 2 passengers per booking is often required for these rates. Prices vary according to service class, city of
          departure, airline, and route, with the East Coast typically offering lower transatlantic fares and the West Coast lower
          transpacific fares.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Dynamic Pricing by Airlines: Please note that the advertised prices may have been based on
          specific conditions at a particular moment that no longer exist when you attempt to book, especially on popular routes
          or during peak seasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Limited Promotional Seats: Many promotional fares are limited to a certain number of seats
          per flight. Once these seats are sold, the promotion may not apply, leading to a possibility of the advertised price
          being unavailable.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Blackout Dates and Travel Restrictions: Advertised prices might not be applicable during blackout
          dates, which often include holidays and peak seasons. Additional travel restrictions such as advance purchase, stay
          conditions, or specific travel days may apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Savings of up to 73% off the full, unrestricted published fares of major
          airlines are possible, but the exact savings will depend on each fare's regulations. Some airlines may charge extra for
          additional baggage. Prices depend on seat availability in the relevant booking inventory, and there is a limited number
          of seats available. Some flights and dates may not have availability. Prices are adjustable, and our partner airlines
          currently offer free exchange and/or cancellation. In the event of a cancellation, clients will retain their travel
          credits with the issuing airline for a year, minus any airline fees, unless otherwise specified. Fare differences may
          apply in case of exchanges. Prices and applicable rules are subject to change at any time without notice, and additional
          limitations may apply. Flyer Club is unable to identify some travel suppliers or itinerary details online to avoid
          direct competition with the travel supplier's normal retail sales
